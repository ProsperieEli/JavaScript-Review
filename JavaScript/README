# A complete overview of the basic and expres features of JavaScript.

## Understanding let and Const.

Two ways to create variables in JavaScript.

<b>let</b>
Variable values that can be reassigned.

<b>const</b>
Variable that will never change and cannot be reassigned.

## Arrow functions.

<!-- arrow function-->
Const myFunction = () => {
    <!-- code here -->
}
<!--arrow function with only ONE(1) argument does not need the "()" in the function.-->

## Exports/Imports.

const person ={
    name:'Max'
}

export default person --> YOU choose the name.

import person from 'person' --> Name is defined by export.

<!--use default when just exporting one thing from that file and can be renamed once in the imported file -->
<!--use {} when importing things by it's name/not default.
i.E export const clean would be import {clean} from ... -->

## Classes.

class person {
    constructor() {
        this.name = 'Max'
    }
    printMyName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}
const person = new Person();
person.printMyName();
<!--Prints 'Max' -->

## Classes, properties and Methods.

*Properties are like variables attached to classes and objects.

*Methods are like functions attached to classes and objects.

myProperty = 'value' --> replaces the constructor in ES7.

myMethod = () => {...} --> replaces myMethod(){} in ES7

## Spread and Rest Operators.

spread --> used to split up array elements or object properties.

ex: const newArray = [...oldArray,1,1]
const newObject = {...oldObject, newProp:5}

Rest --> used to merge a list of function arguments into an array.

Ex: function sortArgs(...) {
    return args.sort()
}

## Destructuring.

Easily extract array elements or object properties and store them in variables.

Array destructuring: 
[a,b] = ['Hello','Max']

Object destructuring:
{name} = {name: 'Max', age: 28}

## Refreshing Array Functions.

const numbers = [1,2,3];

const doubleNumArray = numbers.map((num) =>     {
return num * 2;
});
<!--map affects everything inside the array. That's why 1, 2 and 3 in the original array would be multiplied by 2 and doubled-->
